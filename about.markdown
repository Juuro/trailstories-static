My (internet) name is Juuro and I love mountainbiking. Since 2009 I participate in MTB marathon races and my bike obsession is ever growing since. I live in south-west Germany. Here we have the Black Forrest and the Swabian Alps to ride and with Albstadt the only  (former ðŸ˜¢) Cross Country UCI Worlcup spot in Germany right around the corner.
With this blog I try to canalise my thoughts about cycling in gerneral. But it will be MTB dominated.
