This is the international race calendar on the highest level in cross country for next year. The world wide Covid-19 pandemic is still going on so all these dates could be postponed or even cancellad as seen in the just finished season of 2020.

If these races go along like this it will be a very interesting year packed full with action. It is an olympic year. So everybody will try to be in the beast shape of her and his life. In the short 2020 season we didn't see Mathieu van der Poel on a mounatinbike because he was focusing on the road. Bet he often declared that his big goal are the olympic games and that he intends to win the olympic gold medal in Tokyo on the mountainbike. So I hope to see him at least for the first part of the season at ever world cup leading up to the olympic games. Together with many joungsters like Milan Vader, Jordan Sarrou and Henrique Avancini with his first world cup win tehre is a chance that the mens field will finally become more interesting after a long dominance of Nino Schurter.

In the womens category we have a very dominant Pauline Ferrand-Prévôt. But the other women know whats on the line, there are three olympic medals up for grabs. Kate Courtney didn't have the best season in 2020. But I'm shure she will learn from this and maybe do a preparation with more actual races in 2021. Also it is expected that Jolanda Neff will be at her best again. In 2020 she already showd that after her life threataning crash in the spring she is already back with the speed we love her for. Sadly she got sick exactly for the tweo weeks long XCO season in the fall. Anne Terpstra also was almost there at every race in 2020 and in 2019 she could win her first world cup in the thin air of Vallnord in Andorra. As in the mens field there are also several new guns like Evie Richards who won all short track races of 2020 or Loana Lecomte who manages to win the first elite world cup she participated in.

There are many contenders to have an eye on in 2021. Let's hope next season can happen in a mor normal way than this year.
