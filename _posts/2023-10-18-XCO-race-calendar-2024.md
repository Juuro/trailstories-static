The UCI just released the XCO race calendar for next year. Due to the Olympic Games it wil be a little bit different. For example the World Championships will already held in May. Apart from that we are fortunate enough to wirness a pretty packed XCO season. With ten races on four continents it's also very international.

Great to see Brazil back in the calendar after its acclaimed debut two years ago in Petrópolis. This time even with two back to back weekends on two new tracks.
